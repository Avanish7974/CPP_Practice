//tokens are 1. litrals 2.Variables 3.Constants 4.Operators 5.key-word

//literals are the value whose value tells only by seeing them like A

//variables is a block which have some name and contain some value like age = 30 here age is variable

//Constants Variable are constants its representation is done in capital value and its value is not changable

//Operstors is a special symbol which have some specific meaning like + - *which is use to perform some basic operation

//Key-words are the special pre serve word having pre defined meaning,Key words are never use as a naming convections 

//Rules for naming variable 1. Rame Should be relevant
//me can contain alpha numeric values for ex - Aa123 3.Variable can not contain spaces Variablecan not contain special character except _ and $
//
//If you want to seprate two words then we follow - Snack case,Camel case
//1.cybrom_cpp_studenr;
//2.cybromCppStudent

//Operators
//1. Arithmetic operarors = + - * / %
//2.logical operator = and , or , not 
//3.Assignment Operator = =,+=,-=,/=,%=
//4.Comparison/RElational operator = <less then,<=,>,>=,==,!=
//5. bitwise operator = ^xor,~comp,&and,
//all these five are binary operator
//
//6.unarey(incremantal/decremantal) = ++,--
//7 Tornary operator = ?,:
//8. miscallenous (mist) Operator = .dot,&and,: colon,::,*pointer
